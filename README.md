Web and Mobile Development
</h1>

<p align="center">
Here I keep all my studies and projects related to Web and Mobile development. The repo is divided in six directories: (1) Backend, (2) Web, (3) Mobile, (4) Full Stack, (5) UI and (6) Miscellaneous. Each of them contain projects and/or notes I worked with at some point. The subprojects inside these folders tend to be separated by use case, tools, frameworks and libraries. The "Full Stack" directory, however, contains self contained integrated projects, developed in special coding weeks organized by "RocketSeat".
